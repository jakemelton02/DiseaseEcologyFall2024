## [9/16/2023 - Disease Ecology - Worksheet 2 & 3]{.underline}

**1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

The necessary sample size is 59.\

**2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:**\

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

Sample size requirements

1,000 = 259

10,000 = 295

100,000= 298

\

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

1,000= 205

10,000= 226

100,000= 299\

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\<\_\_\_ (\<, =,\>) \_\_1\_\_%.

Rule of 3: 3/N

Sampled deer (N): 300

3/300=0.01 or 1%\

**4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
Russell counties).**\

a\) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.

[**Lee County:**]{.underline}

Sample Total: 150

Lameness: 30

Prevalence: 30/150= 0.2 or 20%

Confidence Interval using Sterne's Method = 20% (95% CL 14-53%)

```         
lameness 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
```

[**Chambers County:**]{.underline}

Sample Total: 30

Lameness: 8

Prevalence: 8/30= 0.266 or 27%

Confidence Interval: 27% (95% CL 14-53%)

```         
lameness 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
```

[**Russell County:**]{.underline}

Sample Total: 96

Lameness: 3

Prevalence: 3/96= 0.03125 or 3%

Confidence Interval: 3% (95% CL 14-53%)

```         
lameness 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

\
b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.

Pond 1: 30.0

Pond 2: 6.7

```         
 Two-sided p-value:  0.1987 
```

**5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:**\

Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected\

[**Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).**]{.underline}

\
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.

[Day 1: 3/60= 0.05 cases per fish-day]{.underline}

[Day 2: 4/57= 0.07 cases per fish-day]{.underline}

Day 3: 7/53=0.13 cases per fish-day

Day 4: 11/46=0.24 cases per fish-day

[Day 5: 20/35=0.57 cases per fish-day]{.underline}

\
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?

Prevalence= #infected/#population

Day 1: 3/60= 0.05

Day 2: 4/60=0.07

[Day 3: 7/60= 0.12]{.underline}

Day 4: 11/60=.18

[Day 5: 20/60= 0.33]{.underline}

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Day 1 & 2
